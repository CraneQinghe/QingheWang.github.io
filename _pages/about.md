I am currently a second-year master's student at the School of Artificial Intelligence, [Anhui University](https://www.ahu.edu.cn/). Additionally, I am a part of the [Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Hefei Comprehensive National Science Center](https://iai.ustc.edu.cn/iai/), where I am jointly supervised by advisors from both institutions.

I am fortunate to have [Prof. Futian Wang](https://cs.ahu.edu.cn/2022/0929/c20807a294159/page.htm) from Anhui University as my academic advisor, while [Prof. Cheng Li](https://iat.ustc.edu.cn/iat/xnds535/20211209/5388.html) is my advisor from the research institute (previously, my advisor was [Prof. Xinwei Zheng](https://iat.ustc.edu.cn/iat/x223/20190911/2127.html)).

My field of study is artificial intelligence, with research interests that include deep learning, distributed systems, cluster scheduling, and automatic parallelization of large models.

You can reach me at my personal email: 3167360788@qq.com.
